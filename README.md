These are my explorations while learning the ancient Indian language संस्कृत.

Giles Lytton Strachey once said, "Perhaps of all the creations of man language is the most astonishing." I agree with that sentiment. They symbolic language that human beings so effortlessly communicate in has got to be their most amazing creation.

I started learning the language formally in late 2020. A motivation for it was to take a foreign language course for my college admissions. But as time went by, I got more interested in it. The language has so much of literature, art, dramatics, scientific and mathematical exploration, and cultural impact on India and perhaps the world that I am beginning to see the heritage much more broadly now. Of course, I am still a beginner.

One problem with doing "languages" in high schools is their exam orientation. संस्कृत is an unfathomable ocean! But yeah, exams have their place. I started following the संस्कृत-भारती curriculum of "Sanskrit by Correspondence" (पत्रालयद्वारा-संस्कृतम्). This repo is about my explorations with the exams they conduct, but it is not limited to that.

I have taken enough efforts and as a result, the language, its roots, and its literature have created an impression on me. I will try to write about that in this repo.

संस्कृत-भाारती  carries out several exams. They require the student to become increasingly competent with the levels of complexity: प्रवेशः, परिचयः, शिक्षा, कोविदः. I am not sure if I will do all of them, but I will write about what I do.
